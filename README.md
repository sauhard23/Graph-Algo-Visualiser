<h1>Overview</h1>
This project is a Graph Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

<h1>Features</h1>
Interactive Visualization: Easily visualize the graph traversal process step by step.
Customizable Graph: Add, remove, and edit nodes and edges to create your custom graph.
Algorithm Selection: Choose between DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm for visualization.
Speed Control: Adjust the visualization speed to understand the algorithms at different paces.
